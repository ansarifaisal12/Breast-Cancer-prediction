# Breast-Cancer-prediction
This web application uses Streamlit and scikit-learn to create an interface for classifying breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. It employs a Random Forest Classifier to make predictions.
# App Features
Display Dataset: View the first few rows of the breast cancer dataset and its statistical description.
Model Accuracy: Shows the accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier on the test data.
Classification Report: Provides a detailed classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction Interface: Allows users to input their own tumor features to get a prediction of benign or malignant.
# About the Dataset
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset is included in scikit-learn and contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The task is to predict whether the tumor is benign or malignant based on these features.

# Technologies Used
Python
scikit-learn
Pandas
Seaborn
Streamlit
